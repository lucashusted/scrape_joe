		<jp_full_text>The Department of Economics at Bowdoin College invites applications for two tenure-track positions beginning July 1, 2022. We intend to hire at the rank of assistant professor, but exceptional senior candidates will also be considered. The positions are open field, although we are especially interested in candidates with expertise in applied microeconomics. A PhD is expected by the date of appointment.
 
The successful applicants will teach at least one course in their fields of expertise and at least one intermediate core (microeconomics, macroeconomics or economic statistics) or principles course each year. Topics of interest include: health economics, the economics of poverty and inequality, public finance, industrial organization, economic development, or international trade. Teaching load is two courses per semester. We are especially interested in candidates able to make a connection with Bowdoin’s various interdisciplinary departments and programs, such as the Health, Society, and Culture Initiative; Latin American, Caribbean, and Latinx Studies; Africana Studies; Asian Studies; Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies; and/or Digital and Computational Studies. 
 
Bowdoin requires its faculty to have a promise of long-term successful scholarly or artistic engagement and a strong commitment to inclusive excellence in their teaching. (For a description of inclusive excellence, please consult the following resource https://www.aacu.org/making-excellence-inclusive.) Bowdoin College offers opportunities for professional development, a fully-funded, year-long junior sabbatical leave (after three years of teaching and successful reappointment), and regular, generously funded, post-tenure sabbaticals.  
 
Bowdoin is a community that warmly welcomes people of all backgrounds. We encourage applications from candidates committed to the support of an inclusive campus community and those who will enrich and contribute to the College’s multifaceted diversity. We especially encourage people from historically excluded groups to apply. We recognize that recruiting and retaining faculty may involve considerations of spouses and domestic partners. To that end, where possible, the College will attempt to accommodate and respond creatively to the needs of partners and spouses of members of the faculty. 
 
Bowdoin College accepts only electronic submissions. Please visit https://careers.bowdoin.edu to submit: 1) a cover letter that details your scholarly research agenda and describes your teaching experience and interests; 2) a curriculum vitae; 3) a statement that describes your teaching philosophy and how your teaching, scholarship, and mentorship supports our commitment to equity and inclusion; 4) a research paper; 5) the names and contact information for three references who have agreed to provide letters of recommendation. Review of applications will begin November 15, 2021. 
 
Founded in 1794 on the Maine coast, Bowdoin is one of the oldest and most selective coeducational, residential liberal arts colleges in the country. Located in Brunswick, a 30-minute drive north of Portland, the College is in an area rich with natural beauty and year-round outdoor activities. Bowdoin’s reputation rests on the excellence of its faculty and students, intimate size, strong sense of community, and commitment to diversity (36% students of color, 7% international students and approximately 15% first generation college students). Bowdoin College complies with applicable provisions of federal and state laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination in employment, admission, or access to its educational or extracurricular programs, activities, or facilities based on race, color, ethnicity, ancestry and national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, age, marital status, place of birth, genetic predisposition, veteran status, or against qualified individuals with physical or mental disabilities on the basis of disability, or any other legally protected statuses.

		<jp_full_text>The Center for Global Development (CGD) in Washington, DC is now accepting applications for its Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship program. The Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship is a one-year term appointment running from mid-2022 to mid-2023, with the precise dates flexible. The position is intended for new graduates or very recent graduates of PhD programs in the social sciences. CGD is an independent, non-partisan, Washington, DC think tank dedicated to reducing global poverty and inequality through policy-oriented research and active engagement on development issues with the policy community and the public.

CGD studies the policies of the US and other industrialized countries that affect development prospects in poor countries. The Center aims to provide young scholars an opportunity to apply their research skills in an active policy environment, collaborating with a world-renowned research staff of economists and political scientists and taking advantage of the research support of CGD research assistants. Staff work with policymakers seeking rigorous and independent advice on development-related issues. We have extensive links to top development researchers all over the world. Our previous postdocs have subsequently gone on to tenure track appointments at Stanford, U.N.C. Chapel Hill, Yale, Tufts, N.Y.U., U.C. San Diego, the University of Maryland, Georgetown University, University of Pittsburgh, and U.C. Davis. For more information about our former postdocs, please visit http://www.cgdev.org/page/postdoc.

Interested applicants should submit a CV, job market paper, and cover letter. Applications that do not include all three items will not be considered. Your cover letter should describe in some detail the research you would pursue during a year at CGD and signal your willingness to move to Washington for one year (an important selection criterion). Preference will be given to candidates whose research interests align with CGD’s—which is to say that they should bear some connection, broadly interpreted, to the effect of high-income countries’ public or private sectors on low-income countries.

We also strongly encourage you to submit a letter of recommendation from your adviser, which will do much to support your application, but this is not required. After submitting your application online, candidates will receive an email with a link to submit a recommendation letter. This link can be shared directly with your adviser, if you choose.

This position will be required to work primarily in-person, with some flexibility for partial/occasional remote work. CGD is registered to employ staff living in DC, Maryland, Virginia. Candidates must be in one of these jurisdictions by the start date to be eligible.  In compliance with United States federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification document upon hire. CGD will sponsor United States work authorization for this position.  Any offer of employment requiring sponsored work authorization is contingent on CGD and the candidate’s ability to successfully petition for and secure the necessary work visa(s).

CGD celebrates fostering a collaborative, diverse, and inclusive work environment. All qualified applicants will be considered for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, parental status, or veteran status.  We welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons. However, we particularly encourage applications from underrepresented or historically marginalized groups. All appointments will be made on merit of skill and experience relative to the role.

		<jp_full_text>The Center for Global Development (CGD) is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit policy research organization in Washington, DC and London, UK that focuses on the issues and institutions that are critical to inclusive development. Through rigorous empirical research and active engagement with the global policy community, we focus on the policy intersections of low- and middle-income countries and the governments, institutions, and corporations that can be partners in delivering greater progress. 

The Center is seeking a Research Fellow or Senior Fellow (depending on experience and credentials) to lead one or more areas of research on women’s economic empowerment and other gender and development policy issues. The Senior Fellow will define and undertake an agenda of creative, policy-oriented research that looks at issues of high importance to the global gender equality community. Although the primary focus for this recruitment is a Fellow who can lead CGD’s research on gender and development, we are open to applicants from any area of applied development economics related to CGD’s work.

CGD’s gender equality work aims to identify evidence-based interventions and policies to promote women’s economic empowerment, as well as provide guidance on how best to measure progress. We work with colleagues across CGD to integrate an intersectional gender lens into our other programs, such as those focused on global health, education, and migration, as well as into CGD’s own institutional policies. We aim to leverage CGD’s influence on donor institutions and other high-level decision-makers, positioning ourselves both as a go-to resource for learning and a level of accountability, pushing global leaders towards evidence-based policies and investments that promote gender equality.  

The Research Fellow or Senior Fellow’s principal responsibilities will include: 

Design and lead cutting edge research that informs policy debates (with a preference for work on women’s economic empowerment and other areas of global gender equality, but including other areas of global development related to CGD’s work)
Contribute to the intellectual leadership of CGD’s work 
Provide input into the strategic direction to the Center’s overall gender strategy 
Support the mobilization financial resources to support the Center’s work on gender equality and/or other areas, as relevant to CGD’s work    
Engage in related policy outreach activities, including speaking engagements, blogging, and interacting at a high level with key individuals and groups in the donor and technical communities 
Participate in expert group consultations and working groups 
Publish blogs, papers, policy briefs, and/or short commentaries targeted to policymakers, academics, and CGD’s public audience 
Track and respond to research and policy developments in relevant areas 
Review and support CGD colleagues’ research and analysis in relevant areas
Supervise and help professionally develop entry-level research assistants
Engage and contribute to the institution’s wider initiatives around diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as a playing a key part in creating a culture which aligns with our mission and values

The successful candidate ideally possesses the following qualifications: 

Strong preference for a doctoral degree in economics or a related field, but equivalent research track records will be considered 
Extensive experience in the gender and/or development space with a long record of publication and policy influence, and a network of strong professional relationships 
Body of original, scholarly work applying quantitative research to economic and institutional issues
Significant knowledge of current issues and debates in gender equality and/or economic development and related issues within low- and middle-income countries, as well as at IFIs and other donor institutions   
Excellent oral and written communication skills, as well as high level organizational skills  
Ability to work collaboratively within the multidisciplinary team while remaining individually accountable for delivering on research agenda

​​​​​​​Interested candidates should submit a CV, cover letter, and sample publication.  Inquiries can be made to Luke Easley, leasley@cgdev.org.  

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic our organization continues to work primarily remote. CGD has implemented a fully virtual onboarding process, and candidates should be comfortable working productively and managing others in a remote environment. Flexibility to adapt to shifting priorities and tasks will be key. We intend to return to in-person work more fully in early 2022. This position will be required to work primarily in-person along with the rest of our staff at that time, with some flexibility for partial/occasional remote work. CGD is registered to employ staff living in DC, Maryland, Virginia and (via CGD Europe) - the UK. Candidates must be able to live and work in one of these locations to be considered. 

In compliance with United States federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification document upon hire. CGD will sponsor United States work authorization for this position. Candidates who wish to be based in the UK should have the right to live and work in the UK or be willing to relocate as an employee of the US organization via a company transfer. Any offer of employment requiring sponsored work authorization is contingent on CGD and the candidate’s ability to successfully petition for and secure the necessary work visa(s). 

CGD celebrates fostering a collaborative, diverse, and inclusive work environment. All qualified applicants will be considered for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, parental status, or veteran status.

		<jp_full_text>Who We Are
Cornerstone Research is a leading economic and financial consulting firm with more than 700 staff members across eight offices. Working in collaboration with prominent professors and industry experts, we analyze complex economic, financial, accounting, and marketing issues that arise in litigation and regulatory investigations.

Cornerstone Research is involved in a broad variety of high-profile legal cases and disputes. Current matters focus on such topics as capital markets, business and securities valuation, M&amp;amp;A and corporate events, risk management, market competition, high frequency trading, the impact of marketing on consumers, and patent infringement. For example, we address issues affecting the ongoing development of financial markets, such as applying frameworks at the intersection of finance and industrial organization economics to evaluate price setting in derivatives markets. Beyond the financial markets, we address financial and economic issues arising in a range of sectors, from such innovation-driven industries as life sciences and high technology to energy, telecommunications, and industrial markets. We address economic  issues  when  evaluating  potential  mergers,  claims  of  anticompetitive  conduct,  and  the  impact  of  intellectual  property infringement. We also address marketing and economic issues arising in cases with allegations of misleading marketing or false claims. More detail can be found on our website at www.cornerstone.com.

		<jp_full_text>The FCC’s Office of Economics and Analytics anticipates openings for economists in 2022.  The current team of over 60 economists analyzes the telecommunications and/or electronic media industries to make policy recommendations to the Commission.  Working in a collegial team environment with attorneys and engineers, economists apply their analytical and quantitative skills to rulemakings (the creation or dismantling of government regulations), mergers and transactions reviewed by the Commission, and Congressionally mandated reports.  Economists also have the opportunity to publish working papers and other independent research related to communications and Commission priorities.  In addition, the Office of Economics and Analytics maintains a seminar series.  For more information, visit https://www.fcc.gov/economics-and-analytics. 

Economists in all fields of applied microeconomics and industrial organization who communicate well and who enjoy working with a team of economists in an interdisciplinary environment are encouraged to apply.  Experience with the telecommunications or media sectors or regulatory policy is not necessary.  Completion of a Ph.D. degree by the time of hiring is preferred.  The current salary range of GS-12 to GS-15 is $87,198 to $172,500.  Starting salary will be based on educational achievements, work experience, and research accomplishments.

We plan to interview qualified candidates in January 2022 virtually.

To learn more about Board economists’ work in microeconomics, macroeconomics, finance, international economics, economic measurement, and other fields, please browse through the economists’ web pages, which can be found here:  https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/theeconomists.htm. 

Researchers at the Board benefit from extensive and unique data resources, state-of-the-art computing facilities, highly trained and motivated research assistants and analysts, and active speaker series and workshops. Information on resources is available at www.federalreserve.gov/research.  The Board also hosts a Federal Statistical Research Data Center, which allows researchers with approved projects to access restricted-use microdata from the Census Bureau and other agencies to address important research questions. A generous benefits package that includes parental leave and alternative work schedules to support work-life balance is available to Board employees.

Please apply by November 15, 2021, through the Job Openings for Economists website (application link below) with a curriculum vitae, job market paper, questions regarding citizenship in the JOE application, a diversity statement, and three letters of recommendation.

		<jp_full_text>Overview

The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) is an independent, non-profit, federally-funded research and development center that provides objective analyses to the Department of Defense and other federal government agencies. Economists at IDA support senior defense leaders by applying economic theory and analytic methods to issues of National Security policy and resource management. As needed, we apply proven tools to new problems and data, develop new models, and generate new theory.

Recent examples of our work include:

- Constructing mechanisms for the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to care for each other’s patients and to transfer funding across departments
- Exploring alternative organizational structures and delivery methods for educating and training military medical personnel in order to reduce costs and streamline management
- Identifying opportunities to transfer positions among active and reserve military personnel, federal civilians, and contractors in order to reduce costs and concentrate military personnel in more operational (vs. administrative) positions 
- Making recommendations to improve the outreach, hiring, and training of civilian personnel in the - Department of Defense, particularly in key specialties such as cyber, intelligence, foreign language proficiency, and STEM 
- Examining the dependence of the U.S. – and particularly the U.S. military – on overseas manufacturers of computer chips
- Designing a multi-year personnel retention experiment
- Estimating causal effects of staffing levels on mission effectiveness
- Predicting individuals’ career events with machine learning and a rich set of personnel records

We take pride in the high caliber and timeliness of our analyses, our independent thinking, and our objective results. Work at IDA is conducted in a team environment and often involves a multi-disciplinary approach with physicists, engineers, psychologists, and other social scientists. Researchers work closely with and are in frequent contact with government sponsors. Consequently, strong communication skills are greatly valued. 

We will consider job market candidates preparing to graduate, recent graduates, and mid-career individuals.

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the largest source of financing for development in Latin America and the Caribbean, wishes to interview Ph.D.-level economists to work in its Research Department (RES) or other areas of the Bank.

IDB research economists publish regularly in refereed academic journals and pursue policy-oriented, analytical research that enlightens the Bank’s work on development challenges and appropriate policy responses. This research also improves the effectiveness and relevance of the Bank’s operations in its member countries.

Successful candidates would possess: (1) strong technical skills; (2) a record of–or good prospects for—high-quality, original research in peer-reviewed journals; and (3) the ability to communicate with a wide range of potential audiences. Preference will be given to candidates who combine a solid academic profile with an interest in policy, and who have worked on topics relevant to development in Latin America and the Caribbean. 

Areas of Interest:  This call is open to all areas of economics.
 
Staff members of the IDB Research Department will conduct interviews soon after the call for applications is finished and during the window of the ASSA meetings. 

Interested candidates must apply through the IDB careers Webpage. At the time of application candidates will need to upload a cover letter, CV, and job market paper. Additionally, three (3) academic reference letters must be e-mailed to RESjobs@iadb.org. The deadline for applying is November 29, 2021.

We at the IDB are committed to gender equality and encourage women to apply.
We also seek diversity with respect to nationality, ethnicity, race, and educational background. Persons living with disabilities or HIV/AIDS are equally encouraged to apply.

- Drive implementation on 3-5 evaluations to translate findings from the social and behavioral sciences into concrete recommendations, including through collaborating with agency partners to ensure: 
      - intervention ideas and the design meet agency goals; 
      - field experiments are implemented as planned; and,
      - results implications are clearly understood
- Work directly with agency collaborators to design and rigorously test interventions
- Perform data analysis and interpretation 
- Distill findings into reports, policy memos, and academic publications

		<jp_full_text>The Center for Health and Wellbeing (CHW), part of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, invites outstanding researchers to apply for appointments as Postdoctoral Research Associates for a 12-month position starting July 1, 2022. The position would involve working on a CHW project headed by Janet Currie entitled: "Harnessing Big Data to Improve Children's Mental Health Treatment." A PhD in economics is required, as well as experience with the econometric analysis of large-scale administrative data sets.

Applicants should have received a doctorate degree within a year of application or expect to receive a doctorate by July 1, 2022. The program is open to all regardless of citizenship, but it does not support work toward the completion of a degree. The term of the appointment is one year initially, starting July 1, 2022, with the possibility of renewal up to a maximum of three years total appointment time contingent upon satisfactory performance and continued funding. The selected candidate is expected to be in residence during the term of appointment.

Postdoctoral Research Associates participate in activities of CHW, including faculty-graduate seminars, workshops, and public lectures, and enjoy access to a wide range of other activities throughout the University. Postdoctoral Research Associates devote the major portion of their time to research and writing on issues related to health and wellbeing. Some Postdoctoral Research Associates may be invited to teach in one of Princeton's undergraduate programs. Any teaching is contingent on sufficient enrollments and must be approved by the Office of the Dean of the Faculty.

Applicants are evaluated on the basis of (1) the quality of their achievements in their field of specialization and their ability to benefit from the activities of CHW; (2) the fit between their interests and the project; and (3) the contribution they are likely to make to research in the future.

		<jp_full_text>Princeton University is pleased to announce the call for applications to the Fung Global Fellows Program at the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies (PIIRS). Each year the program selects scholars from around the world to be in residence at Princeton for an academic year and to engage in research and discussion around a common theme. (Note: if the Covid-19 pandemic prevents a residency at Princeton, Fellows will remain in their home country and participate in the program remotely.) The number of candidates hired will depend on the qualifications of the overall applicant pools.  Candidates will be considered in two categories: (1) Postdoctoral research associates who received their doctorate from an institution outside of the United States and who, at the time of application, do not hold a tenure-track faculty appointment; (2) Early-career scholars employed outside the United States who have a faculty appointment, a professional research appointment, or are an established independent scholar in the designated theme of the program. Early-career scholars will be appointed at the rank of Visiting Research Scholar.

In 2022-23 the Fung Global Fellows Program theme will be “Sustainable Futures.” We welcome applicants from all disciplinary and inter-disciplinary fields– humanities, social science, natural science, engineering, technology, law, architecture – to examine varied notions and workable practices of sustainability. For more information about the theme of study please visit: http://piirs.princeton.edu/funggfp/about/annual-research-topics. 

Applications due on November 15, 2021 (11:59pm EST). 

To be eligible, post-doctoral applicants must have completed all requirements for their Ph.D. September 1, 2022 but cannot have more than two years of postdoctoral experience prior to the start of the appointment, September 1, 2022. If a postdoctoral candidate has turned in a final draft of their dissertation but not yet completed their Ph.D. before the start date, they may be temporarily appointed as a Senior Research Assistant with a 10% reduction in salary until providing verification of their Ph.D. degree. Early-career scholars must have received their Ph.D. or equivalent no earlier than September 1, 2012. Fellowships will be awarded on the strength of a candidate’s proposed research project, the relationship of the project to the program theme, the candidate’s scholarly record, and the ability to contribute to the intellectual life of the program. 

Postdoctoral scholars may apply at:  https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/21301 
Early-career scholars may apply at:  https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/21302 

This position is subject to the University's background check policy.For more information visit http://piirs.princeton.edu/funggfp/call-applications.

		<jp_full_text>The University Center for Human Values at Princeton University invites applications for Laurance S. Rockefeller Visiting Faculty Fellowships for the academic year 2022-23. Fellows devote an academic year in residence at Princeton to research and writing about topics involving human values in public and private life. This full-time visiting program is open to scholars in all disciplines provided their research plans qualify. In recent years fellows have been drawn from fields including philosophy, political theory, literature, history, classics, economics, and law, but this list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Fellows are expected to reside in or around Princeton, or demonstrate to the program’s satisfaction the ability to be on campus on a daily basis and on short notice in order to fulfill responsibilities relating to in-person participation. Fellows are expected to be active contributors to the intellectual life of the Center. This includes participating in a weekly seminar attended by fellows and Center faculty to discuss work in progress and in various other seminars, colloquia and lectures sponsored by the Center. Fellows enjoy access to Firestone Library and to a wide range of activities throughout the University. 

Candidates must have a doctorate or equivalent professional degree and a strong record of research publications appropriate to their career stage. Typically Fellows hold faculty positions at other universities or colleges; in exceptional cases we consider applications from independent scholars when there is a high level of scholarly achievement. This is not a postdoctoral fellowship program and we do not generally consider candidates who will have held the Ph.D. for less than two years at the time of appointment.

The fellowship period extends from September 1 to July 1. Fellows normally receive stipends of up to one-half their academic-year salaries (subject to a minimum and maximum set each fall). Ordinarily their home institutions provide a portion of their salaries in addition to all benefits, although this is not a requirement for appointment. Stipends for independent scholars will not exceed the maximum for fellows holding appointments elsewhere.

The main considerations in the evaluation of applications are the following:
•	The significance of the proposed research and its relevance to the purposes of the University Center for Human Values (see http://uchv.princeton.edu/ for more information); 
•	The quality of a candidate’s previous research and the contribution the candidate is likely to make in the future through teaching and writing; 
•	The likelihood that the research would benefit from being conducted in the University Center environment.


How To Apply
Candidates must submit an online application at https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/20741.
The following materials will be required:
1.	A curriculum vitae; 
2.	A scholarly paper (of no more than about 12,000 words) written in the past three years;
3.	A statement (of no more than 1,500 words) describing the proposed research project and including a brief working title for the project; and
4.	Contact information for three referees, including at least one who was not a graduate advisor.  
Referees will be contacted directly with instructions for uploading letters of reference. 

These materials must be submitted online by the application deadline of Monday, November 1, 2021, 11:59 p.m. ET.  We do not accept application materials by any other method. The selection committee begins reviewing applications immediately and incomplete applications may be at a disadvantage. Decisions are expected to be announced in March 2022.

		<jp_full_text>The Stanford Graduate School of Business has four postdoctoral fellow positions in honor of Professor Edward Lazear, generously funded by one of his former students, James Liang.  These fellows will have the opportunity to conduct their own independent research while both collaborating with the GSB’s world-renowned faculty and participating in the school’s dynamic research-oriented environment.  The four available Lazear-Liang postdoctoral positions correspond to each of four following topic areas (research tracks):

1.	China’s Economy
2.	Demography 
3.	Entrepreneurship
4.	Any business topic

The Lazear-Liang Postdoctoral Program welcomes applications from scholars from any disciplinary background working on one of these four topics.  Special consideration will be given to candidates working on topics with broad applicability to the China context.  Candidates working on China-related research projects will have an opportunity to collaborate with the newly created Stanford Center for China’s Economy and Institutions during their appointment.

We seek to support, deepen, and enhance the important research in these areas long underway at the business school and across Stanford University.  We welcome applicants from all research disciplines and are interested in candidates whose research demonstrates impact.  

The postdocs will be joining a large and diverse cohort of postdocs at the GSB and across Stanford University.  Stanford postdocs have full benefits and access to various training programs to facilitate career development, provided by the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs.

The ideal candidate is preparing for an academic position in a field closely aligned with these topic areas, for which the postdoctoral fellow position would serve as an excellent opportunity to deepen their research background and experience. Fellows will be mentored by a GSB faculty member and will have the opportunity to collaborate with research scholars, staff, and PhD students interested in their areas of interest.  Mentorship of the postdoctoral fellows will be structured according to each fellow’s research and professional interests. 

Application Details
Review of applications will begin on November 15th, 2021 and will continue until all the positions are filled. Candidates are invited to apply online via https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/jobs/faculty-recruiting/lazear-liang-postdoctoral-program, with the following materials: a curriculum vitae, a research statement of no more than three pages, and the names of three recommenders. The successful candidates should have or must expect to have their PhD degree by the start date of their postdoc appointment. We also ask each applicant to identify a research track and highlight GSB faculty they are particularly interested in collaborating with during their appointment.  Please direct questions to gsbpostdoc_affairs@stanford.edu.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to our mission at the GSB. We believe we will best enact our educational and research missions when all members of our community are able to leverage the experiences and ideas of others, embrace different viewpoints, feel that they belong, and know that their contributions are valued.

		<jp_full_text>The Development Research Group (DRG) of the World Bank is seeking to recruit researchers. DRG is the main unit, where policy-relevant research on development in low- and middle-income countries is conducted at the World Bank. Most researchers in DRG have a PhD in economics. However, we are open to hiring highly qualified researchers working on important issues related to development from other fields. Researchers are expected to maintain an outstanding scholarly publication record. They are also asked to provide relevant policy advice and technical expertise to colleagues throughout the World Bank, and to policymakers in client countries.

This year, we are open to applications from candidates with interests in all fields relevant to development, but we have some important areas of focus. Therefore, candidates with research and expertise in the following fields will receive more attention than others: 

•	Economics of education (with a focus on service delivery), 
•	Capital markets and banking, with a focus on development, which could include the role of digital financial services (PhD in finance preferred) 
•	Trade policy,
•	Cross-cutting fields addressing environmental challenges: Trade &amp;amp; Environment; Sustainable Finance; Green Growth; or Distributional Impacts of Energy Transitions
•	Active labor market policies and jobs programs

We seek candidates with (i) strong technical skills; (ii) a record of – or good prospects for – 
publication of high-quality original research in peer-reviewed journals, (iii) the ability to communicate technical knowledge and expertise in a policy environment; and (iv) excellent spoken and written proficiency in English. We are primarily considering new PhDs but open to candidates with relevant post-doctoral academic or non-academic experience.

For the application through the JOE online system, we prefer that candidates provide a link to their personal webpage, which should include their CV and links to their papers, including their job market paper. If you provide this link, you do not need to upload a CV and a job market paper separately. All applicants, however, should upload three academic references via the JOE online application system.

		<jp_full_text>An Economic Analysis Fellowship opportunity is available at the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development (ORD) located in Cincinnati, Ohio, through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE).  This research project is to study the economic impacts of remediation and restoration at Great Lakes Areas of Concern. The research participant will conduct research collaboratively with ORD staff and the Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO) of EPA's Region 5 office. This research will apply a variety of economic approaches (e.g., both market and non-market valuation such as from I-O modeling, hedonic models, and benefit transfers) to quantify the benefits and costs of remediation and restoration projects in Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs). The research participant will collaborate with a multi-disciplinary group of individuals including but not limited to water quality modelers, engineers, economists, ecologists, and social scientists evaluating remediation, restoration and revitalization (R2R2R) outcomes. The R2R2R framework was developed by GLNPO and ORD to help fulfill Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement commitments "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Waters of the Great Lakes." Potential endpoints of analysis include improved water quality, restored designated uses, and/or ecosystem services.

		<jp_full_text>Uber is looking for economists with a passion for tackling hard problems with real-world impact. We are economists, statisticians, operations researchers, and computer scientists who combine theoretical insight with rigorous data analysis to expand the value created across Uber’s real-time marketplaces. Economists at Uber work on teams across the company in a variety of roles; we will match hires to roles best suiting their interests and expertise.

Economists at Uber solve key business problems. Responsibilities are varied but include designing pricing and incentives structures, modeling and estimating long-term consumer behavior, developing novel approaches for marketplace experimentation, and creating ML-driven optimization of marketplace levers. Markets are at the heart of our business model, and economists are central to our strategic decisions and algorithmic solutions. 

We hire economists to be economists, not generic data scientists. Uber is the ideal first job for a new PhD economist looking to work in industry–you’ll learn how to be effective in a dynamic and successful company that's already convinced of the value and potential of economic thinking, alongside experienced economists in technical and organizational leadership positions.

(We're also interested in professors looking to move into industry/tech jobs.)

What You'll Do
-Solve ambiguous, challenging business problems using data-driven approaches
-Work closely with multi-functional leads to develop a technical vision and drive team direction
-Develop new methodologies for data science including modeling, coding, analytics, optimization, and experimentation
-Present findings to business leaders to inform decisions
-Design product experiments and interpret the results to draw detailed and impactful conclusions

Basic Qualifications
-Ph.D. in Economics or related field
-Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python/Matlab/Stata/EViews
-Foundational programming skills in R/Python/C/C++/Java and the desire to learn

Preferred Qualifications
-Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems
-Familiarity with relational databases and SQL a plus
-Software engineering skills in C/C++/Java/Python/etc.
-Experience in experimental design and analysis (e.g., A/B and market-level experiments), as well as in causal inference with observational data
-Experience in algorithm development and prototyping

We are actively hiring and are always interested in hearing from exceptional candidates. As well as hiring on the usual timeline, we'll gladly consider candidates for start dates as early as November 2021.

Uber is an Equal-Opportunity Employer.</jp_full_text>

		<jp_full_text>Assistant, Associate, Full Professor - International Development Policy - Goldman School of Public Policy

The University of California, Berkeley faculty and academic leadership have identified the Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) as a priority for growth and prominence. We invite applications for an open-rank position in international development policy. The Goldman School holds the #1 US News and World Report ranking in policy analysis, and we are committed to expanding our scholarly reach in the stated area of interest.

We seek a scholar with exemplary methodological and quantitative analytic skills, a strong record of success with sponsored research and external funding, and who desires a substantive leadership role within our Masters of Development Practice (MDP) program, along with other GSPP degree programs or centers. The GSPP faculty are highly interdisciplinary and take pride in having a diversity of perspectives that help to understand and solve public problems. We seek candidates with a variety of specializations, including but not limited to: development and resource economics; growth models, including those taking into account innovation, human capital, and social capital; linkages between investments in human resources, civil society, economic growth, and democratic stability and evaluating investments in these areas; the impact of international trade, globalization, and international development agencies on development; and policies to account for cross-border challenges, including health crises and natural disasters.

The ideal candidate will be in their mid-career stage, likely at the advanced Assistant or Associate Professor level, and thus expected to have a distinguished scholarly record sufficient to be awarded tenure at UC Berkeley, at the time of hire or shortly thereafter, along with a demonstrated strong commitment to teaching. GSPP has a diverse faculty that is committed to all forms of diversity, and we encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.

Candidates must hold a Ph.D. at the time of appointment in economics, planning, political science, public policy, sociology, or another discipline relevant to international policy.

Scholars should have a demonstrated record of consequential research and a clear interest in teaching in, and advancing further, the School's MDP and Masters in Public Policy (MPP) professional programs, including through pursuit of international partnerships. We encourage applications from individuals with an understanding of, and commitment to, the public university mission, as well as a familiarity with schools of public policy. Prior policy-related work experience is desirable. The Goldman School is particularly interested in candidates who will contribute to diversity, inclusive perspectives, collegial respect, and support for underserved student populations through their intellectual voice and actions in research, teaching, and service. This commitment to advancing equity and inclusion is essential for GSPP, as our excellence can only be fully realized if our entire community shares in the commitment to these values.

The Goldman School of Public Policy is committed to addressing the family needs of faculty, including dual career couples and single parents. We are also interested in candidates who have had non-traditional career paths or who have taken time off for family reasons, or who have achieved excellence in careers outside academia.

		<jp_full_text>Postdoctoral Scholar Employee Positions, The Center for Commerce and Diplomacy (CCD)
Department: School of Global Policy and Strategy
Salary: Commensurate with experience

Appointment: 12 months (extendable based on mutual agreement and available funding)

Start Date: September 2022
The Center for Commercial Diplomacy (CCD) at UC San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) invites applications for two postdoctoral scholar employee positions from individuals with a Ph.D. degree or who expect to receive a Ph.D. degree by September 1, 2022, for the 2022-2023 academic year.

These awards are designed to promote high-quality research on the challenges and institutions of international economic diplomacy in a changing world. Research projects that seek to understand the causes and consequences of the institutions of economic globalization (e.g. GATT/WTO, FTAs, BITs, IMF, World Bank, Fast-Track, TPA, RTAA, etc) are particularly welcome. Commercial diplomats operate within a set of domestic and international institutions that govern their behavior in international negotiations. But we know little about the specifics of these rules and procedures, how they came into being, how they vary over time and across countries, and how they affect economic outcomes. Postdoctoral research on the institutions of economic globalization can help answer questions about the welfare and distributional consequences of these institutions and, ultimately, result in the better design of these institutions.

Outstanding scholars anywhere in the world are eligible to apply. The Center invites applications from candidates with a background in economics, political science, economic history, legal history, and other disciplines bearing on the study of economic diplomacy. Selected candidates will be required to be in residence for the duration of the appointment, health conditions permitting, and to interact with faculty and Ph.D students, giving at least one research talk. Selected postdoctoral scholars are also expected to attend CCD events and related seminars, and to post their research on the CCD website.

Qualifications:
PhD in economics, political science, economic history, legal history and a research track record in the relevant domain by the start of appointment.

Applicants are required to hold a Ph.D. by September 1, 2022 To apply, please upload the following documents to the recruitment link here: https://apptrkr.com/2530643.

1. Cover letter explaining the candidate's scholarly career, prospective or actual doctoral defense date, and academic interests.
2. Current curriculum vitae including publications.
3. One writing sample (limit of 100 pages).
4. Contributions to Diversity Statement
5. Three letters of recommendation sent directly to https://apptrkr.com/2530643

		<jp_full_text>The Center for the Economics of Human Development (CEHD) at the University of Chicago is actively seeking Postdoctoral Scholars. CEHD’s research program is guided by Professor James J. Heckman and includes a comprehensive array of interrelated and interdisciplinary projects and initiatives that promote a thorough empirical understanding of human flourishing, social mobility, and creating and measuring skills. CEHD’s current work considers both empirical and theoretical studies of family and neighborhood dynamics and innovative empirical studies on the role of home-visiting and parent-child interactions in the formation of children’s skills. The postdoctoral scholar will conduct empirical research on the broad themes of this group in consultation with their faculty mentor and other senior scholars. 

The postdoctoral scholar will reside at CEHD at the University of Chicago. CEHD, located in the Saieh Hall for Economics, stands in close collaborative proximity to the Department of Economics, the Becker Friedman Institute, and the Thirty Million Words Center for Early Learning and Public Health. This provides access to a wealth of seminars and classes at the University of Chicago, and opportunities to meet and collaborate with senior scholars. 

Compensation will be tailored to a candidate's qualifications and past experience. Comprehensive benefits plans will be available. Unique data sets on long-term experimental evaluations are available. There are opportunities for travel to present and/or collaborate. Research budget may be available for projects in close alignment with the Center’s research agenda. Terms and start dates are negotiable. Two or three-year arrangements have proven to be the most productive in defining and executing projects.

Requirements:
•	PhD in Economics or Public Policy required
•	Strong background in applied econometrics required
•	Interest in advancing understanding of human development across the life cycle, including  the role of early childhood education, home-visiting and parent-child interactions in the formation of skills, intergenerational mobility, neighborhood mobility, and the formation of economic preferences.
•	Independent evidence of competence in these areas required (doctoral thesis and other papers)  
•	 We have a particular interest in candidates with experience conducting field experiments.


For questions or additional employment information, please email PostDocsforHeckman@gmail.com or use the “Comments” section in the form. DO NOT send inquiries or materials to Professors Heckman directly.

The second year of residency (ideally with degree in hand) is spent on academic career development while again teaching just one course.
